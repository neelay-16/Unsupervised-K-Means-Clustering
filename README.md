# Unsupervised-K-Means-Clustering

The code loads a dataset, performs KMeans clustering with two clusters, and visualizes the results using a scatter plot. The 'Satisfaction' and 'Loyalty' features are used to identify natural groupings or clusters within the data.

# Installing the required libraries

Install the python libraries pandas,matplotlib,scikit-learn using the pip command
